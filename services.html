      <h2 class="section-heading">Property Lettings & Management</h2>
      <p>
        We take care of the entire lettings process — from marketing your property and securing quality tenants,
        to managing every detail of the tenancy. This includes rent collection, maintenance coordination,
        compliance checks, and regular inspections, so you can enjoy the returns without the stress.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the Renters Reform Bill set to bring major changes to tenancy laws, now more than ever landlords
        need an agent who understands the legislation and can keep them compliant while still protecting their
        interests.
        We stay ahead of regulatory changes so you don’t get caught out, ensuring your property remains
        profitable and legally secure.
