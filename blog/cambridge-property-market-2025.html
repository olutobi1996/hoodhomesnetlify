      <p>
        Official data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that the average house price
        in Cambridge was about £498,000 in August 2025, similar to August 2024. This is far higher
        than the East of England average of £343,000 and the UK average of £273,000.
      </p>

      <p>
        Prices vary by property type: semi-detached houses rose 1.8% year-on-year, while flat prices fell 1.5%.
        Monthly rents averaged £1,772 in September 2025, up 3.9% from the previous year.
        First-time buyers paid around £418,000, while mortgage buyers averaged £493,000.
      </p>

      <p>
        Private reports broadly corroborate these figures. Investropa estimated the average price at £507,000
        in mid-2025 and noted that Cambridge property prices increased by 7.4% year-on-year.
        CIA Landlord Insurance calculated a higher average rental yield of 5.74% across Cambridge — above the
        national average of 5.33%. In the city centre (CB1–CB5) average house prices were about £439,775 with
        yields of 3–4%, while northern suburbs (CB24) offered yields around 4%.
      </p>

      <p>
        Cambridge estate agent Ellis Winters described summer 2025 as a buyer’s market: more homes were
        available and sellers had to price competitively to attract interest. Rightmove reported a 0.3%
        drop in asking prices, while Nationwide’s index showed a 0.8% decline. Despite this, July 2025
        was the busiest month for sales since March 2022.
      </p>

      <h3>Demand drivers</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>High student and professional demand:</strong> About 31% of households rent privately,
            thanks to the city’s two universities and the growth of Silicon Fen technology and biomedical sectors.</li>
        <li><strong>Rising rents:</strong> Average monthly rents of £1,755 in early 2025 were 8.7% higher than a year earlier.
            Rental yields of 4–5% can be achieved in some areas despite high property prices.</li>
        <li><strong>Regeneration and infrastructure:</strong> Cambridge is investing in new council homes in East Barnwell
            and redeveloping the Grafton Centre. Efficient rail links, cycle routes and the new Cambridge North station
            improve accessibility and support long-term capital growth.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Investors must, however, plan for high entry costs and changing regulations. Professional advice is recommended
        to navigate this competitive and evolving property market.
